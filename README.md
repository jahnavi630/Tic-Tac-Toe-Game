# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with an X or O, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The code would probably include functions to manage the game board, handle player turns, check for win conditions, and determine a winner or tie.
